# Detailed Documentation for Clyne Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the detailed documentation of Clyne, an integrated system for cryptocurrency wallet management and mining operations, built with the latest technologies and global security standards. Clyne operates on its own proprietary private network exclusively supporting Cryptonel (CRN), our native cryptocurrency.

**About Cryptonel (CRN):**
Cryptonel is the platform's exclusive digital currency with the ticker symbol CRN. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, CRN operates on Clyne's private network rather than a public blockchain. This provides enhanced control, security, and performance optimization. CRN serves as the only currency within the ecosystem, enabling transactions, access to premium features, and participation in the platform's governance. The mining algorithms for CRN are specifically optimized for energy efficiency within the Clyne network environment.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the entire Clyne ecosystem, covering everything from technical architecture to deployment procedures. I'll explain everything from A to Z.

    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret_password

  redis:
    image: redis:7.0
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./clyne-backend
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
      - redis
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:secret_password@mongodb:27017/
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
      - ENVIRONMENT=production

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./clyne-frontend
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - frontend_build:/app/build

  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.23
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - frontend_build:/var/www/html
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
    depends_on:
      - backend
      - frontend

volumes:

```

**Running with Docker Compose:**
```bash
# Start all services
sudo docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
sudo docker-compose ps

# View logs
sudo docker-compose logs -f
```

### 6. System Monitoring and Maintenance

**Monitoring Setup:**
```bash
# Pull Prometheus + Grafana stack (using Docker)
git clone https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom.git
cd dockprom

# Edit configuration files as needed
nano docker-compose.yml

# Start monitoring stack
docker-compose up -d
```

**Regular Maintenance Tasks:**
- Database backup (daily):
  ```bash
  # Set up automated MongoDB backups
  0 1 * * * /usr/bin/mongodump --out /backups/mongodb/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)
  ```

- Log rotation:
  ```bash
  # Install logrotate if not already present
  sudo apt install logrotate -y
  
  # Configure log rotation for application logs
  sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/clyne
  ```

- Software updates:
  ```bash
  # Script to update backend dependencies
  cd /path/to/clyne-backend
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U -r requirements.txt
  
  # Script to update frontend dependencies
  cd /path/to/clyne-frontend
  yarn upgrade
  ```

### 7. Load Testing and Performance Tuning

**Load Testing Tools:**
- Installation of load testing tools:
  ```bash
  # Install k6 for load testing
  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69
  echo "deb https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install k6 -y
  ```

**Performance Tuning:**
- MongoDB optimization:
  ```bash
  # Edit MongoDB configuration
  sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
  
  # Important settings to tune:
  # - wiredTigerCacheSizeGB: 4  # Adjust based on available RAM
  # - maxIncomingConnections: 2000
  ```

- Redis optimization:
  ```bash
  # Edit Redis configuration
  sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
  
  # Important settings to tune:
  # - maxmemory 4gb
  # - maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
  ```

- Nginx optimization:
  ```bash
  # Edit Nginx configuration
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  
  # Important settings to tune:
  # - worker_processes auto;
  # - worker_connections 2048;
  # - keepalive_timeout 65;
  # - gzip on;
  ```

### 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Backend Issues:**
- Service not starting:
  ```bash
  # Check service status
  sudo systemctl status clyne-backend
  
  # Check logs
  sudo journalctl -u clyne-backend -n 100 --no-pager
  ```

- Database connectivity issues:
  ```bash
  # Check MongoDB status
  sudo systemctl status mongod
  
  # Test MongoDB connection
  mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
  ```

**Frontend Issues:**
- Static content not loading:
  ```bash
  # Check Nginx configuration
  sudo nginx -t
  
  # Check file permissions
  ls -la /var/www/clyne/
  ```

- API connectivity issues:
  ```bash
  # Test API connection
  curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/status
  ```

**Deployment Issues:**
- Automated deployment script for quick recovery:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  
  # Pull latest changes
  cd /path/to/clyne-backend
  git pull origin main
  
  # Restart backend service
  sudo systemctl restart clyne-backend
  
  # Pull and build frontend
  cd /path/to/clyne-frontend
  git pull origin main
  yarn build
  
  # Deploy new frontend build
  sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/clyne/
  
  echo "Deployment completed successfully"
  ```
